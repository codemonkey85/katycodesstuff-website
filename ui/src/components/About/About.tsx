        <p className='bigger-margin'>Hello! I’m Katy Ashby. <br />
        I started my tech career as a Physics graduate,
        who liked the “coding bits” of my course.<br />
        Fast forward to today, and I have been working as a Software Developer for 5 years, moving up quickly from Junior to Senior and Lead roles.
        </p>
        <p>
        My expertise is primarily within C# and .NET, alongside Angular and TypeScript on the front end. 
        I have a DevOps mentality with extensive experience in managing infrastructure via Azure cloud, Docker and Kubernetes.
        </p>
        <p>
        I started my Twitter account in September 2021 as a means to share my insights into being a Senior Developer and leader within tech.<br /> 
        Since then it has grown into a community of over 18,000!</p>
